# DSA

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are essential concepts in computer science that involve organizing and manipulating data efficiently to solve complex problems. DSA can improve the performance of software applications by optimizing memory usage and reducing execution time. Common examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, and trees, while sorting, searching, and graph algorithms are examples of common algorithm types. Proper understanding of DSA is crucial for developing efficient and optimized software applications that can handle large amounts of data and complex operations.
